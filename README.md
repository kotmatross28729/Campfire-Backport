You can also use the command "/campfirebackport dumpinfo" to create a text file in your config folder that has this information.

The normal jar embeds [Mixin 0.7.11](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin). Mixin is Copyright (c) SpongePowered & contributors and is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).  
The "+nomixin" jar doesn't, and requires a separate mixin mod such as [UniMixins](https://github.com/LegacyModdingMC/UniMixins).
